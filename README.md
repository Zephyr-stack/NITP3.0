SETUP:-
We used ganache as our local blockchain with trial ethereum accounts with all the transactions being carried out on these accounts. We used solidity to code the smart contracts for our blockchain. The coding of the smart contract was done on remix ide. The interaction of the smart contract with the Flask API backend was done using python's web3 library.
